# Hands on Python Data Structures

## Overview
This project explores the foundational data structures in Python including **lists**, **dictionaries**, and **tuples**. This is done through practical, hands-on tasks and it was created as part of my Cognizant Externship.

## Tasks Covered

### 1. Working with Lists
- Created a list of five favorite fruits
- Appended a new fruit to the list
- Removed a fruit using `remove()`
- Reversed the list using slicing

### 2. Exploring Dictionaries
- Created a dictionary containing personal information (name, age, city)
- Added a new key-value pair for favorite color
- Updated the city value
- Printed all keys and values using a loop

### 3. Using Tuples
- Created a tuple with three elements: favorite movie, song, and book
- Demonstrated tuple immutability by attempting (and failing) to change a value
- Printed the length of the tuple

## Example Data (Custom)
- Name: Jordan Wang  
- Age: 21  
- City: Portsmouth → updated to New York  
- Favorite Color: Green  
- Favorite Movie: *Revenge of the Sith*  
- Favorite Song: *苦茶 - 心动版*  
- Favorite Book: *I'm not so sure*

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to practice manipulating Python data structures and understand how they’re used to store, organize, and protect information.
